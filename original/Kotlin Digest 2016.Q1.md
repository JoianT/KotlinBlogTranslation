Welcome the Kotlin Digest of Q1 2016. It was in this quarter that Kotlin 1.0 was released, and naturally the number of articles and coverage received has substantially increased.<br/>

We want to thank everyone for their contributions, and highlight some of the most notable articles and blog posts.
