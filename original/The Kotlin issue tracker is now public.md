Following the tradition of other JetBrains projects, we’ve opened up the issue tracker for Kotlin to the public. In the issue tracker, you can see some of our thinking and things we’re working on, and you can also file issues asking for new features in the language or changes in the current design. We hope that the tracker will let us keep the discussion more structured than the comments in the blog and on Confluence pages.
The URL for the tracker is:  [http://youtrack.jetbrains.net/issues/KT](http://youtrack.jetbrains.net/issues/KT)
