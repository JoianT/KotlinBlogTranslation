Today at the [JVM Language Summit](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/mlvm/jvmlangsummit/) , JetBrains is unveiling the new project we’ve been working on for almost a year now. The project is <strong>Kotlin</strong>, a new statically typed programming language for the JVM.
With Kotlin, we’re building upon the many years of experience creating development tools for different languages, and hoping to provide a language which is productive enough for today’s environment and at the same time simple enough for the ordinary programmer to learn.
Right now Kotlin is under active development and nowhere near mature enough to be used by anyone outside of the development team. What you can do today is read the [language documentation](http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/Kotlin/Welcome) and leave feedback on the design of the language — what features you like, which ones are missing, what’s confusing and so on.
One thing to note: since we’re a development tools company, we’re building first-class IDE support for Kotlin in parallel with the language itself. And as soon as the language reaches its beta stage (currently planned for the end of 2011), we’ll release both the compiler and the development tools as open-source under the Apache 2 license.
There’s still a huge amount of work ahead of us, and we’re excited to hear what you guys think about our latest endeavor. So let the discussions begin!
