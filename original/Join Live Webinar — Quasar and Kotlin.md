Join us <br/>
<strong>Wednesday, September 16th, 16:00 – 17:00 CET</strong> (10:00 – 11:00 AM EDT) for our free webinar, [Quasar: Efficient and Elegant Fibers, Channels and Actors](http://info.jetbrains.com/Kotlin-Webinar-September2015-registration.html) with Fabio Tudone.
Quasar fibers bring true lightweight threads to the JVM as well as Erlang-like actors, Go-like channels and Dataflow programming: this means we can efficiently use straightforward blocking APIs and regular stack-based control flow rather than submitting to cumbersome and infectious async and monadic styles.
After an introduction about fibers, their workings and Quasar’s additional abstractions we’ll explore how Quasar uses Kotlin
