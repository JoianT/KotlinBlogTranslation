Apple has introduced “a better language” for iOS developers. But what options do we have for Android? Surely, Kotlin should be under consideration! Android Studio is now based on IntelliJ IDEA, the “native” environment for Kotlin.
Kotlin can help you reduce the amount of code you write for Android applications and at the same time make it readable and more maintainable. In this session we’re going to see how certain constructs and DSL’s can be used to make Android more enjoyable.
