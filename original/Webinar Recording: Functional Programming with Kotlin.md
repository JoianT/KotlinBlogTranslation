The recording of our October 22nd webinar, Functional Programming with Kotlin, is now available on JetBrainsTV YouTube channel.
In this talk, Mike Hearn provides a brief introduction to programming in Kotlin via practical example: creating a textfield with the autocomplete suggestions while typing. Demo project is available on GitHub.
Topics covered include:

* Use of functional transforms
* Immutability
* Lazyness and working with lazy infinite sequences
* The use of funKTionale, a library that extends Kotlin with a few features known from Haskell
* Pattern matching
* Reactive user interfaces
