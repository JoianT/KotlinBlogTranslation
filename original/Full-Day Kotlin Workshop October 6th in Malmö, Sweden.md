Edument, a JetBrains Training and Consulting Partner, will be providing a full day of Kotlin hacking on Monday, October 6, 2014, in the lovely city of Malmö.

* Full-Day Kotlin Workshop: learn more and register now.

The hands-on workshop will begin by walking through the basic syntax, and work its way towards unit testing and language features such as object orientation and functional programming. In the afternoon we will consider use-cases such as writing a domain-specific language and seeing how the syntax and semantics of Kotlin help with some common problems that you may encounter in languages such as Java and C#.
Snacks and drinks will be provided during the day.
Space for this Kotlin Workshop is limited; learn more and register now.
