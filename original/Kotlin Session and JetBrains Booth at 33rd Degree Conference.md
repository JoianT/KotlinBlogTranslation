Kotlin: Beyond Dogmatism 
Thursday, March 14th, 10:10 AM – 11:10 AM, Room D
Kotlin is a new language developed by JetBrains and licenses under Apache 2 OSS License, targeting the JVM and JavaScript. When presented, the typical questions asked are “Why another language? What core fundamentals does it bring to the table?” Tell you what, let’s move beyond dogmatism and be pragmatic. Let’s focus on the problems we’re trying to solve when developing applications and see why and how Kotlin can help us.
Developers: Prima Donnas of the 21st Century 
Friday, March 15th from 13:10 – 14:10
“We are developers. We are creators. We are misunderstood by customers, by managers and even co-workers; we are undervalued and often overworked. People don’t appreciate the value we put in our craft and our drive for innovation. We are central to business in the 21st century yet people don’t appreciate us!” Of course you are, but you also forgot to mention: You suck at communication. You often put business at risk based on personal ambitions and waste serious amounts of time trying to improve and discuss the wrong things, all in the name of the next great thing that’s going to solve it all. You’ve completely forgotten the plot! Don’t believe me? Why don’t you come along to this talk and get a wakeup call. But don’t expect to be treated nicely.
