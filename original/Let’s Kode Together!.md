As  [Kotlin Web Demo](http://kotlin-demo.jetbrains.com/)  is the simplest way to try Kotlin. Today we unveil some new features that make it even more fun.
<strong>HTML5 Canvas</strong>
We added support for HTML5 Canvas (for the JavaScipt back-end) so that you can now do something like:
<span id="more-388"></span><br/>
Watch it in action on YouTube:  [http://youtu.be/iee75Dtw83k](http://youtu.be/iee75Dtw83k) 
<strong>Note</strong> that in order to use Canvas, you need to select the JavaScript (Canvas) run configuration in the panel on the right.
<strong>Sharing your programs</strong>
Also, you can now save a program you wrote in and share a public link to it:

0. Go to the Web Demo, and log in with you Google, Facebook or Twitter account.
1. Write a program, e.g. solve a problem from the Problems section, Save it in your private space.
2. Share your solution with everyone: press the Public link button next to your saved program and press the  button next to the URL, or share the link any other way.

As an example, here’s a public link to the program from the video above:<br/>

<strong>P.S.</strong> BTW, you can now have <strong><a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/Kotlin/Functions#Functions-Localfunctions" target="_blank">local functions</a></strong> in your programs, as well as the new form of <strong><a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/Kotlin/Control+structures#Controlstructures-barewhen" target="_blank">when</a></strong>.
