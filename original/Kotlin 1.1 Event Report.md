The Kotlin 1.1 release was warmly met by the community. To demonstrate the new features in Kotlin 1.1, JetBrains offered an online event. All those interested were able to watch a live stream of Andrey Breslav’s demo presentation and get their questions answered during a Q&A session.
This motivated many local communities to meet up: more than 30 user groups hosted events in 21 countries.
You can find the full list of the events at [the Kotlin community web page](http://kotlinlang.org/community/talks.html?time=kotlin) . Over 3000 people joined the broadcast on the day of the event.
The recording of the demo presentation and the Q&A is available on YouTube:

## Kotlin 1.1 Event Feedback

If you watched the live stream, we want to know what you think! Please share your feedback by [completing this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgKsJzwc1ToAusi-xpEiiE1O4t3HA5xjlbZXDU5Mg0i3qvNg/viewform) . It should only take about 7-10 minutes. Your input is very important in helping us improve all future Kotlin events.
## Kotlin Future Features Survey

We also offered all communities to make an impact on Kotlin future. Event organizers received survey kits and event participants could have a say on the most expected features in an off-line mode. The survey gained much attention, and we’ve now placed it online to listen to the wider community. Now you can [have your say on the Kotlin future](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdnCgBonEV5pwN8L903BzdYb9Baf0dpwsJ5YrKnxLveiLFkEQ/viewform) online!
Please note it’s more likely that you won’t see those features in v1.2, but we will take your opinion into account when prioritizing our work.
