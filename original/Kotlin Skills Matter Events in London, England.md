Join Andrey for his talk **Wednesday, April 3rd at 18:30** and get an overview of the Kotlin language and the principles behind it. Among other things, the following features will be covered:

* Static null-safety
* Extension functions
* Higher-order functions and type-safe builders
* Smart casts: Kotlin’s lightweight pattern matching
* Enhancing existing Java APIs with Kotlin
* Developing mixed Kotlin/Java projects

<span style="font-size: 16px">Hadi will be hosting a free workshop **Thursday, May 2nd beginning at 9:00 AM**. There will be a **limit of 20 delegates** so you need to be quick. Lunch will be provided courtesy of JetBrains.</span>

You’ll discover some of the advantages that it offers, understand how to get the best of Object Orientation and Functional paradigms, create custom DSL’s and remove some of the pain of other popular languages such as Java and C#. You’ll see how to test your code, interop with existing frameworks as well as discover some of the new frameworks, such as web development frameworks, already available for Kotlin.</span>
<em><span style="font-size: 16px">The workshop will be hands-on, so bring your laptop, and for the best results, have IntelliJ Ultimate OR the free Community Edition installed.</span></em>
