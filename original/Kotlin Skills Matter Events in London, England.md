JetBrains has two free Kotlin events coming to London in April and May. Both sessions will be held at Skills Matter eXchange and registration is required. We hope to see you there!
In the Brains of Andrey Breslav: Introduction to Kotlin
Join Andrey for his talk Wednesday, April 3rd at 18:30 and get an overview of the Kotlin language and the principles behind it. Among other things, the following features will be covered:

* Static null-safety
* Extension functions
* Higher-order functions and type-safe builders
* Smart casts: Kotlin’s lightweight pattern matching
* Enhancing existing Java APIs with Kotlin
* Developing mixed Kotlin/Java projects

Hadi Hariri’s Introduction to Kotlin Workshop
Hadi will be hosting a free workshop Thursday, May 2nd beginning at 9:00 AM. There will be a limit of 20 delegates so you need to be quick. Lunch will be provided courtesy of JetBrains.
In this hands-on workshop, you will learn about the basics of the language. You’ll discover some of the advantages that it offers, understand how to get the best of Object Orientation and Functional paradigms, create custom DSL’s and remove some of the pain of other popular languages such as Java and C#. You’ll see how to test your code, interop with existing frameworks as well as discover some of the new frameworks, such as web development frameworks, already available for Kotlin.
The workshop will be hands-on, so bring your laptop, and for the best results, have IntelliJ Ultimate OR the free Community Edition installed.
