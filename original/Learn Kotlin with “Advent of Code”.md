Christmas is coming! Are you prepared? It’s time to gift yourself with a new language!
Have you already checked out the amazing series of puzzles “Advent of Code” by Eric Wastl? These tasks have pretty lean and expressive solutions in Kotlin due to it’s functional programming features.
Try to solve them all! In Kotlin!

You can write your solutions in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition which is free and supports Kotlin out of the box.
Moreover you can solve tasks in the Kotlin playground right in your browser. We’ve added special template for “Advent of Code” puzzles:
